# oak-phenology-app

This code runs a shiny app for visualizing NEON oak phenology data from the Harvard Forest, Ordway-Swisher Biological Station, and San Joaquin Experimental Range NEON sites. It was developed by Jackie Matthes at Wellesley College for teaching in Introduction to Organismal Biology as part of the QUBES NEON Faculty Mentoring Network.
